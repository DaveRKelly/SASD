Add Tooltips to GUI

Definition of "Tooltip": a non-intrusive small on-webpage pop-up that appears once the user has clicked on an appropriate tooltip "?" icon. The icon will display next to a GUI element until the user clicks on the "?" again to dismiss the pop-up. The pop-up contains a concise, informative description of the function of the specific GUI element next to the icon. The popup specifically appears at the location of the box.

This task is to add a tool tip on all GUI elements in Team A's Form that our team, Charlie Brown, has added (i.e. Tolerance text box, Tolerance value type radio buttons, hint text box, image textbox, all related buttons).
This implementation will come after further discussion with the team on what the display should contain for each element.

Reasoning:
Tooltips inform the user on the specific function of the GUI element in question. This allows for non-intrusive informing of the user. If this is deemed wanted by the Product Owner, then a User Story of applying Tooltips to all GUI elements will result from this task.
