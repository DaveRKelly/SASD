Definition of "Tooltip": a non-intrusive small on-webpage pop-up that appears once the user has hovered in place and without action over a GUI element for 5 seconds. The pop-up contains a concise, informative description of the function of the specific GUI element being hovered over. The popup specifically appears at the point where the mouse is located with the mouse out of the way of the text of the pop-up. Once the mouse is no longer hovering over the popup box, the box will disappear after 1 to 2 seconds.

This task is to add a tool tip on all GUI elements in Team A's Form that our team, Charlie Brown, has added (i.e. Tolerance text box, Tolerance value type radio buttons, hint text box, image textbox, all related buttons).

Reasoning:
Tooltips inform the user on the specific function of the GUI element in question. This allows for non-intrusive informing of the user. If this is deemed wanted by the Product Owner, then a User Story of applying Tooltips to all GUI elements will result from this task.
