# System Analysis and Software Design (SASD)

SASD is a computer science course offered at Duquesne University. The primary goal of this course
is to introduce me to various concepts and techniques that are increasingly used to produce high
quality software that is intended to have a long life cycle and that may require a team effort to 
produce. Secondarily, this course serves to provide me with a taste of what it is like to be
part of a software development team working on a product that is of interest to someone other
than the members of the class. 

The class project is to improve the functionality and user experience of WeBWorK (http://webwork.maa.org/).
This repository serves as my contributions to the project.
